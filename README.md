## Features

- User accounts: Users can create an account and log in to the platform.
- Goal setting: Users can create goals for different areas of their life such as
  fitness, work, personal growth, and more. They can set the frequency, target,
  and deadline for each goal.
- Heatmap visualization: The platform generates a heatmap based on the user's
  daily progress towards their goals. The heat map will visually show the
  progress of each goal with darker colors representing more progress and
  lighter colors indicating less progress.
- Progress summary: Users can see a summary of their progress towards their
  goals, including the number of days they have completed their goal, their
  average progress, and their overall success rate.
- Notifications: The platform will also send notifications to users when they
  have completed their goals or when they are falling behind.
